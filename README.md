### Introduction

2D Portal is a puzzle-platformer game inspired by the Portal series of games. The player navigates through a series of levels by strategically placing portals in two different places and moving between them.

### Features

In 2D Portal, users can:

- [x] Move and jump around the map using movement keys
- [x] Shoot portals onto walls using mouse buttons
- [x] Move between the two portals
- [x] See a description of the controls, and objective of the game

### Screenshot

The app consists of a main canvas element with gameplay elements inside, with a description of the game in modal form (by clicking on the description button):

### Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

* HTML/CSS/SCSS
* JavaScript for game physics and logic.
* HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering.
* Webpack to bundle up the JS files.
* Font Awesome for icons.

### Technical Challenge

The most difficult technical challenge for this project was translating the users coordinates and velocities when they go through portals. The collision detection algorithm used for this project returns a letter based on the side that the box was hit on. Using this information, I take the side that the exit portal was shot on and use that to determine how to teleport the player. For instance, one of the cases in the switch statement for my teleport function is as follows:

```JavaScript
export const teleport = (player, box1, box2) => {
  switch (box2.dir) {
    case 'b':
      player.x = box2.x + box2.width/2 - player.width/2;
      player.y = box2.y - player.height - 1;
      if ( box1.dir === 'r'
            && player.velY > 0) {
            player.velY = -player.velY - player.velX;
      }
      if ( box1.dir === 'l'
            && player.velY > 0) {
            player.velY = -player.velY + player.velX;
      }
      if (box1.dir === 'b') {
        player.velY = -player.velY;
      }
      break;

      ...
  }
}
```

### Development Build Steps:
1. `npm install`
2. For making changes to scss: `sass --watch scss:css`

##### Hint for levels 10-11
* 10 - You can still shoot portals when the game is paused.
* 11 - The reset button preserves your velocity. :)
