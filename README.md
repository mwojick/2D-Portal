## 2D - Portal

### Background and Overview

2D Portal is a puzzle-platformer game inspired by the Portal series of games. The player navigates through a series of levels by strategically placing portals in two different places and moving between them.

### Functionality & MVP

In 2D Portal, users will be able to:

- [x] Move and jump around the map using movement keys
- [x] Shoot portals onto walls using mouse buttons
- [x] Move between the two portals
- [x] See a description of the controls, and objective of the game

### Wireframes

The app will consist of the main canvas element with the gameplay elements inside, with a description of the game on the side (or potentially in modal form). This is an example of one potential view of the game:

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented using the following technologies:

* HTML/CSS/SCSS
* JavaScript for game physics and logic.
* HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering.
* Webpack to bundle up the JS files.
* Font Awesome for icons.


### Implementation Timeline

#### Over the weekend
- [x] Looked at various tutorials on basic 2D javascript platformers.
- [x] Implemented a simple canvas window with player and objects. Has basic collision detection, arrow key event listeners, and velocity/gravity/friction attributes.

#### Day 1
- [x] Reorganize file structure, and put elements like the player, canvas, and key mapping into different classes.
- [x] Implement mouse controls for the user to shoot blue and orange portals.
- [x] Implement collision detection between portals and walls, and portals and players
- [x] Teleport player between portals.

#### Day 2
- [x] Implement new type of block that you can shoot through but can't pass though.
- [x] Design custom bitmap editor to make level design simpler.
- [x] Import sprites for player and walls.
- [x] Add additional levels.

#### Day 3
- [x] Continue to add additional levels.
- [x] Add keyboard/mouse controls to the side.

#### Day 4
- [ ] Add button to show description of the game.

### Development Build Steps:
1. `npm install`
2. For making changes to scss: `sass --watch scss:css`
